# LlamaIndex + KDB.ai code samples

## Introduction
The provided jupyter notebooks aim to demonstrate examples of the using KDB.AI vector database with LlamaIndex to industry specific use-cases.

## Getting Prerequisities

* Install python
    * [v3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* Setup KDB.ai server by following this [guide](https://code.kx.com/kdbai/gettingStarted/kdb-ai-server-setup.html).

* Install requirements
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Use-Cases

* [Multimodal RAG](https://github.com/saipjkai/llamaindex_kdbai/tree/main/multimodal_rag): Multimodal RAG implementation with images and text.
* [Hybrid Search](https://github.com/saipjkai/llamaindex_kdbai/tree/main/hybrid_search): Combine dense and sparse search to improve accuracy.
* [Sub-Question Sub Query Engine](https://github.com/saipjkai/llamaindex_kdbai/tree/main/subquestion_subquery_engine): Sub-Question Sub Query Engine implementation.
* [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://github.com/saipjkai/llamaindex_kdbai/tree/main/retrieval_augmented_generation): LLM-RAG implementation.

## View & Execute The Samples

1. Run a jupyter notebook session

    ````
    $ jupyter notebook --no-browser
    ````
    This will load up the jupyter session in the background and display a URL on screen for you.

2. Paste this URL into your browser. This will bring up the samples for you to interact with.
